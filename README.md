# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical features. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains several rows and columns with data about individuals. The prediction model classifies the data, returning `0` for no heart disease and `1` for the presence of heart disease.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key indicators. The machine learning model uses a dataset from Kaggle that contains various features of individuals. The output is a binary classification: `0` for no heart disease, and `1` for the presence of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various columns representing medical information about individuals, such as:
- age
- sex
- cp (Chest pain type)
- trestbps (Resting blood pressure)
- chol (Serum cholesterol levels)
- fbs (Fasting blood sugar)
- restecg (Resting electrocardiographic results)
- thalach (Maximum heart rate achieved)
- exang (Exercise-induced angina)
- Oldpeak
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- ca (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)
- Thalassemia
- target

The target column is a binary variable indicating whether the individual has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
